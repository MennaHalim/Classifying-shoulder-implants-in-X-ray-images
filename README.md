# Project Objective: 
Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA) is a type of surgery in which the damaged ball of the shoulders replaced with a prosthesis. Many years later, this prosthesis may be in need of servicing or replacement. In some situations, such as when the patient has changed his country of residence, the model and the manufacturer of the prosthesis may be unknown to the patient and primary doctor. Correct identification of the implantâ€™s model prior to surgery is required for selecting the correct equipment and procedure. 
# Data set description: 
Images were collected by Maya Stark at BIDAL Lab at SFSU for her MS thesis project. They are from The UW Shoulder Site, manufacturer websites, and Feeley Lab at UCSF. The original collection included 605 X-ray images. Eight images that appeared to have been taken from the same patients were removed, resulting in the final 597 images. The final set contains images from the following manufacturers: 83 from Cofield, 294 from Depuy, 71 from Tornier, and 149 from Zimmer, resulting in a 4-class classification problem. Class labels are provided as the manufacturer name in file names.
